# rollsm
The Wordpress ROllSM site theme and plugin for registration and scoring.
RollSM is a site dedicated to Greenland Rolling for kayaks. This repo arose due to a need for a robust registration and scoring system to be handed over each year to a new arrangement and staff. The hurdles to get it going should be as small as possible.
On the tech side of stuff, there is a WP plugin to handle the data and possibilities for admins of the site to use the participant's data and save the score.
