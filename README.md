# RollSM
The Wordpress ROllSM "Competitors" plugin for participant registration and judges' scoring of Greenland Rolling competitions. 
This plugin arose due to a need for a robust system handed over each year to a new organizer. The hurdles to get it going should be as small as possible. 


## Installation

1. Download the RollSM plugin.
2. Upload the plugin files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
4. Use the plugin settings page to configure the Roll names.
5. A default Wordpress "page" will be created with the URL (slug) '/competitors-display-page/'.


## Features

- **Competitor Registration**: Allows competitors to register for events directly through the WordPress site.
- **Scoring System**: Admins can score competitors based on their roll performances and publish the score live as it is saved, ensuring an interesting, fair and transparent competition.
- **Customizable Maneuvers**: Admins can define their own rolling maneuvers names, making the plugin adaptive to many languages.
- **Language Support**: The plugin's readiness for translations and internationalization is somewhat scarce. If you like it, cheer me on and I will try a little harder! Or, you can contribute to the code yourself!


## Usage

- **Adding Competitors**: Navigate to the RollSM section in the WordPress admin to add competitors on the spot or use shortcodes to add a form for online registration.
- **Scoring**: During a competition, enter scores for each competitor through the RollSM admin panel. As soon as you save, the score is live.
- **Shortcodes**: Use `[rollsm_register]` to display the registration form and `[rollsm_scoreboard]` to display the scoring board on any page.
