# RollSM
The Wordpress ROllSM plugin for registration and scoring.
RollSM is a Wordpress plugin dedicated to kayak Greenland Rolling competitions. 
This plugin arose due to a need for a robust registration and scoring system to be handed over each year to a new arrangement and staff. The hurdles to get it going should be as small as possible.

## What
Wordpress plugin to handle competitor registrations. When a competitor has registered, an admin (ie. judge) can give the competitor a score for each of their roll performances. The admin can also write their own rolling maneuvers, in their own language, which will reflect in the registration form and scoring board. The plugin crates a Wordpress page, the stipulated 30-something Greenland rolls and one competitor by default.
